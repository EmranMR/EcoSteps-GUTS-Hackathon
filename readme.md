A multifplatform web app which tracks a user‚Äôs steps and weight and publishes an embarrassing post to their social media and donates money to an environmental charity of their choice if they don‚Äôt meet a daily threshold. On the flipside, if a user does meet a given daily streak, they also get to donate money to an environmental charity of their choice giving them a dopamine hit and rush of endorphins!

### Environmental impact:

- Donation to environmental charities
- Encourages walking over use of environmentally damaging transport modalities
- Walking as a healthy behaviours may compound into other healthy behaviours such as eating a more plant-based diet, which in turn has a significant environmental impact
- A healthier population drives economic productivity increasing capital available for environmental investment

### Technologies used:
- Open AI DALLE3 for logo generation
- Laravel PHP framework website backend/frontend: ü§©
  * TailwindCSS
  * Chart.js
  * Vitejs
- Python backend to connect with:
  * Google fit API to obtain user‚Äôs step count and weight
  * Mastodon API to post to user‚Äôs account
  * Push, pull and update data to database
- Firebase firestore database to store user data and allow Laravel frontend to access it

### Accessibility features:

- Takes into account partially sighted users and those with other visual impairments by ensuring all page elements have alt txt
- Responsive front end web design to allow for access via multiple platforms and screen sizes
- Ability to interface with different health data i.e. not only steps to take into account for example users with limited mobility or wheelchair users

### Future features to be implemented:

- Add further health data tracking to further take into account accessibility e.g. heart rate to take into account any form of exercise
- Continue improving UI to add e.g. github-style streak tracker
- Add further carrots to our mostly stick-centric model e.g. achievement badges, rewards system such as free t shirts (made of sustainably sourced materials)
- Finish connecting the frontend to the database

### Scaling to production ready codebase:

- Integrate with Verint Da Vinci AI to analyze user trends to provide personalized advice, generate more embarassing mastodon posts
- Finish implementing the charity donation backend code to interface with stripe/paypal API
- Host frontend
- Migrate backend from local machine crontab to e.g. AWS lambda or raspberry pi server for continuous uptime
- Migrate database from firebase to a more scaleable/maintainable solution e.g. SQL
- Implement automated tests e.g. using cucumber
- Consider implementing a business model e.g. ad revenue, sponsored challenges, VC funding, IPO
